################### Heartbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only some common options.
# The heartbeat.reference.yml file in the same directory contains all the supported options
# with detailed comments. You can use it for reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/index.html

############################# Heartbeat ######################################

# Configure monitors
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http

  # List or urls to query
  urls: ["http://localhost:9200"]

  # Configure task schedule
  schedule: '@every 10s'

  # Total test connection and data exchange timeout
  #timeout: 16s

#================================ General =====================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging


#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
#setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  #host: "localhost:5601"
